# yt-comment-behavior-analysis

This project analyzes comments from YouTube videos to explore trends in activity and sentiment over time. It ingests comments from the YouTube API, stores them in a local database, and computes rolling metrics to help identify patterns in discussion dynamics.

The goal is to experiment with data-driven analysis of public conversations while building a flexible foundation for further exploration.
